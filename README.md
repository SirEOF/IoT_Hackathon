# StayFocussed

![mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8709386/27508028-3f221dda-58dd-11e7-8648-593f592cf18c.PNG)

## Project Goal

StayFocussed is a service enabling improved concentration during lectures, more flexible scheduling of breaks, enhanced productivity, unified break start and ends. The complete service shall be designed and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should be implemented in a two day Hackathon.

Cognitive performance is influenced by multiple factors such as lighting, air quality and individual need for rest. Within the scope of a two day hackathon, our goal was to develop a prototypical solution to improve students’ concentration and productivity during lectures by suggesting breaks and other actions when appropriate. The recommendations are based on human input and real-world data – in our case generated by a sensor infrastructure given at Herman Hollerith Zentrum.
Additionally, our goal was to build a service based on our solution. Therefore, we have applied several scientific methods such as Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas and Business Process Modeling.
